    <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to
        separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron. </p>
    <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among
        home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy. </p>

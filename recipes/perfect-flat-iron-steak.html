        alt="close up viewof sliced flat iron steak on top of salad">
    <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to
        separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron. </p>
    <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among
        home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy. </p>

            <p>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the
                refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours. </p>

            <p>
                Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4
                minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.
